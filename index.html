                This is a mock up of a potential portfolio that will be used for presentation to future employers. Please note that this page is a work in progress. All information will be updated as time goes by. This is a project developed during UCSD Extended Education Coding Bootcamp. The profile image is my actual main character in a MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV. My developer name is twqueen; it is short for Taiwanese Queen. I am not affiliated to any royal families or lineages. It is just a nickname my friends and I developed because we believe we should all live like Kings and Queens and treat everyone with respect as you would towards royalty. I am still learning and trying many new things to this webpage. If you have any tips, suggestions, questions, or concerns, please contact me through github or in-game (maybe) &#128521
