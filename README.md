# Portfolio-Webpage

## Description
Mock up portfolio sample using HTML and CSS learned from first two weeks of coding bootcamp. The purpose is to make it look as presentable as possible and will showcase all projects for employers to see. 

The images and "projects" are all just placeholders. Please don't expect to see actual developed webpages/projects made by me. All personal information are fabricated.

This webpage may be used as reference in the future to create a real portfolio for future employers.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Have fun and enjoy the page. Maybe spark an interest to play FFXIV.
